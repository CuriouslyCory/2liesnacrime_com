            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Getting into a lot of shenanigans.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            But that&apos;s okay. Let&apos;s make some great friendships. <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Yeah, absolutely <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Wine. And true crime.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            And who would have known I had no idea. I remember the day when I said, Hey, have you heard of this website? And you were like, yeah. It&apos;s like, wait, what?<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            I think that was only like, a couple years. <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            It really was.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            So I don&apos;t know if I if this will offend you. And I was excuse you. <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            I&apos;m a Patreon. What do you<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            what just happened?<br />
            <br />
            Unknown Speaker  <br />
            So then you decided that it would be a wise decision to start a podcast <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Podcast? i This is my decision. <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Well, I mean, <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            it was our decision. I thought we were <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            in our drunken stupers, we always agreed on a route. <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            I think it took us six months to figure out what to do.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            And it wasn&apos;t even my idea. <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            We use new wine was gonna be involved. <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Absolutely. <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            So but ya know, it all started because I was telling my stepdaughter, true crime story. And I got so many facts wrong. And I was like, this is ingenius. This is what... I was a little drunk. A little <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            A little, <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Just a little drunk. And I and I had like, major facts incorrect. They weren&apos;t like, <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            you were embellishing or embellish. There you go. <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            So instead of the serial killer killer only killing well not only but killing 15<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            He only killed 15<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            ...15 women said he killed like 52 Just a few more. <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Just a tiny bit. So thus, this podcast was born.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Amazing. Righty <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            it really is. <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            So today we&apos;ve already drinkin<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            drinkin is not a word.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            How many times <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            we&apos;ve drunk <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            we&apos;ve drank two bottles the bottles? We had Stella Rosa black. <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Yes. <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Which is lovely. and wonderful.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            It was the very first time you introduced me to that was red. That got me smashed. And now we&apos;re drinking the worst wine.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            I am. This is I&apos;m not a fan of this one. But it is getting like making my tongue fuzzy. It has something in there.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            It&apos;s just it&apos;s the Apothic Rosae. And it says it&apos;s a Rosae with the with dark secrets and the dark secret is that it&apos;s terrible.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            it&apos;s really that but it&apos;s it&apos;s I think it&apos;s only bad in the beginning. Because<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            because you&apos;re not drunk in the beginnings when<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            you keep drinking. It gets better and better. Nice, fine wine for you just, you know, the more you just sip on a little bit, it just gets it warmes up to you. Maybe that&apos;s the secret is that it warms up to you and knocks you on your bum. <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            There you go either. Yeah. Okay, well, wine suggestions will always be accepted. <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Yes, please. And if you would like to send us your way. And<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            yes, we will accept that too. We will try it. And we will always give a really good honest review. Again, I don&apos;t think we&apos;re gonna be getting apothic rose as a sponsor.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Again, it sneaks up on you. So it&apos;s, I mean, was it terribly expensive? <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            No, it was like $6 <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Oh so. So then<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            wine. It&apos;s amazing. Amazing. Because I feel like I got it when we were I was out of town and I didn&apos;t have enough liquor in my life. So I went and got it and I was like this is $6 Because I was paying a hefty price for the Jameson that I was really going for.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            I&apos;ve never chased with wine.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            you&apos;re doing it wrong.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Oh my. Sorry, I just<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            so bad. <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Took a large drink and yeah, it&apos;s definitely a sipping wine. You got to sift through this one.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            There was a movie where it was while we were sleeping. And they told her to drink the eggnog very slowly and she was like, wanting to spit it out. She couldn&apos;t, that reminded me of that.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            While you were sleeping... they did that?<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            It was in a movie. And it was like, spiked eggnog. And they said, just to drink it slowly because it was terrible. And so she took a small sip, and then she was like, looking around like wanting to spit it out, because it was so bad.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            I could see that. I&apos;m not a fan of liquor in eggnog. But like I try every year, but it&apos;s<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            like it&apos;s still not good.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            It&apos;s like fruitcake.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Fruit cake tastes like brown.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            It really does. I don&apos;t know what brown tastes like, but it tastes for taste. <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Exactly, 1000%<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            I did hear I gotta tell you because So last year, I think it was in September. Yeah, September 2021. A woman she wakes up and she finds her burglar sleeping in her guestroom. He took he took a dip in the pool, the leftovers and went to sleep in the guest room. Like it was it her own his own? Airbnb. Isn&apos;t that fantastic?<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Could you imagine?<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            How many like dealers, they take stuff,<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            and they just got super tired. And they&apos;re like, I&apos;m just gonna take a nap before I head out.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            I think I said that, like her wallet was stolen. Because like her her husband had left but her brother in law was there and so he like scared him away and then they found I think I would call the cops let him sleep. Like hide in the bedroom lock the door.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Goldilocks in my bed. But it&apos;s a man and he stole my stuff.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            But like his, no, you went swimming because his wet trousers were on the side of the pool.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Awesome. At least he enjoyed himself.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Living the best life ever.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            I think that is yeah, that&apos;s like my there&apos;s a story that I heard where this guy kept getting random credit card purchases on his credit card and the he wasn&apos;t making any couldn&apos;t figure it out because he had his credit card. And then he found out that his wife kept leaving the door unlocked and going and taking naps and his neighbor would come over and steal his card and then go down to the store, buy food lotto tickets and then go back and put his card back in his wallet.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            What? What a horrible neighbor.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            So he got in trouble...<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            I hope so.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            People are weird.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Okay, good. I gotta tell you, yes. Yes, yesterday was July 8, right. Right. And it was actually the anniversary of the death of Oh my goodness. Sarah Ann Walker. I don&apos;t know who that is. Yeah, she was a real estate agent in McKinley. Nope. Is that right?<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            I don&apos;t know. I don&apos;t even know the story. <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Apparently neither do I. No, I do know this because I I was fascinated that a who was literally July 8th yesterday, so I felt like Sarah was like calling to me, because every time I look at something else, I just kept going back to her stories.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            She needs her story told does.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            She does!<br />

            Gretta Jane  <br />
            What&apos;s her name? Sarah?<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Sarah Ann Walker. <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Sarah Ann Walker. Okay, who was a real estate agent?<br />
            <br />

            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />

            Well, maybe they went into the home, they couldn&apos;t find the sales agent out here. But they went into the living room, and it was like a brawl had happened in this room, and then a trail of blood led into the kitchen. And that&apos;s where they found Sarah Ann Walker. <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Oh my gosh, <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            She had been stabbed 27 times. Crap. I know.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Sounds like vicious attack.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            It is a vicious attack! But there was no leads whatsoever. The police did. Well, in the beginning, there was no leads. The police did find in the investigation that she was bitten on her neck. They found that there was a blood stain on the lock the door. And there was drops of blood that were like perfectly drops. Like somebody was walking and it dropped, you know? <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Yeah. <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            So because she was stabbed so many times. They figure they were able to find that those drops were not the same blood as hers. <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Okay.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            so that was the killers blood along with the blood that was on the lock. <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            So she fought.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            she did if that was the brawl, I mean. I know. Yes. So then three weeks later, a man calls in and says I think I know, I saw the killer. They were in his wife got a call from someone claiming it was like Chan Lee, that he wanted to go look at a house that was across the street from the model home. Okay, and she was a real estate agent. So she agreed to meet him but she felt really uneasy about it. Because he a told her that she he was staying in a hotel. And when she called the hotel back, he there was a lesson there. So she had her husband come with her, which is smart. So, um, and when her husband and her were waiting in the car first and there was a man in a white mustang that came walking up. And he asked him Are you Chan Lee? And the guy didn&apos;t say anything, just looked around and then walked off. Back in his car and drove away. Okay. Then they they decided to go into the house that they were selling and wait inside. Well, they saw Sarah Walker go to work. First off, I think he was like checking her out because he was like, hey, look, there&apos;s this attractive blonde going.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Who was checking her out? <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            The husband? <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Oh the husband, Okay.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            So first off, I saw this on forensic file. Okay, let me put that away. Yeah. Interview with him. He was like, very, very intrigued. Active blind coming up with this postcard. <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            That&apos;s creepy. <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Yeah, I thought it was kind of creepy, but he&apos;s not the killer. So.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            So Well, thanks for the spoiler.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            But he was enough intrigued with her that he checked her out saw what time she came in. Even thought about they even thought about going and visiting with her. Right, <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Right. <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            But they decided they&apos;ll just go home. Let her do her job. First, I think the wife was like, I&apos;m not gonna go visit some attractive real estate agent.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            That you obviously find attractive. <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Exactly. Smart. Yeah, sorry. Anyways, so. So they left and 20 minutes later, that&apos;s when Sarah Walker was found. <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Oh, God. Thats fast.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Yeah, because it was they left at one and she was found that like 1:20<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Holy cow. Yeah. So when they saw her go in, he she must have been immediately attacked<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            must have or very soon when they left. They saw the white Mustang behind her car. <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Yeah. Wow. Okay. <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            So, but it had been a few weeks. So the police didn&apos;t or they weren&apos;t sure that he could clearly identify him got it. They only got a little glimpse things like that. So they hired a psychic <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Of course they did<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            to read. <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            As you do.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            For written they call it a forensic psychic.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Oh my god. That&apos;s a real thing. You could totally do that. <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Me. <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Yeah,<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            probably could I can get any answers for any I seriously,<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            you are like with your tarot cards and your intuition, you&apos;d be like, they&apos;re in a river, facedown. 500 miles away. And then they show up and they&apos;re like, Oh, I didn&apos;t mean that river. I meant the other 500 miles the opposite direction<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            opposite during that I&apos;d probably be that way. The river on the other side of the country. That&apos;s that would<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            be $5,000. My fee. Thank you.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            have a nice day. But this psychic was able to get enough information from him that they were able to identify, like make a composite, like drawing, right? <br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Yeah. <br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            But it worked.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Maybe he was really good at describing<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            this is bullshit. But it worked. Okay, you were able to put out a like a drawing. And then here&apos;s another tip. Another real estate agent calls in and says, I rented like a house to that guy. But yeah, this guy has a fetish with real estate agents, apparently. So she had got him. I think it was a, like a house or something to rent, whatever. So he rented a place but one night he came to her house, asking if he could use her phone and she said no. Don&apos;t you have your own phone? Right? Like what year is this? This is a year ago? No, this was 2006. Okay, but still headphones<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            back to wasn&apos;t a good phone, but I had one right. Or you could just use a payphone. I mean, those are available to me at least back in 2006. Maybe not now, but. Okay. So she said no.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            She said no, he got really mad to her being on a door and went to her back door. On her back door. Nope. Her dog started freaking out. He managed to break the door in from the back and she and the dog like started to attack attack him. And she ran out the front door to her neighbor. Okay, called the police. And then he had like, escaped. And of course he did. He did. So, here&apos;s the thing. I don&apos;t know how to say this guy&apos;s name. Oh, okay. But I do have a recording. I&apos;m like, Heck yeah. Audience or whoever&apos;s listening. You will know. I&apos;m horrible in<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            25 year old costume chatter Come on. I wouldn&apos;t even see<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            a stool check a c&apos;mon. Something like that has to that&apos;s not the lie.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Well, it&apos;s recorded.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            My husband do that.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            With those scary music and<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            I know how to do stuff. Heck, yeah. Alright, so. So he was 25. He&apos;s 25. He had been in and out of jail since he was 15 years old. He was America. Yes. Okay. So his parents were immigrants, but he was born here. And I forget where they were from. Doesn&apos;t matter. It&apos;s about him. So exactly. He was in like high school. He had gotten in a fight with another student at school and beat him so badly that he that&apos;s what ended him in juvie. Okay. And then he was in and out for like petty crimes like theft and things like that. Six months prior, though he had been released from North Carolina jail for being for he went into jail for holding up two elderly women and like kidnapping them for two days. Yeah, she didn&apos;t do anything to him today. He didn&apos;t kill them.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            But did he do other things?<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            They didn&apos;t go into that. They just said why he was on parole. So he was in parole in Texas because a sister lived in Texas. So she was willing to like put them up and get his life in order and things like that. Well,<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            I bet she&apos;s second guessing those choices.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Right. So she, anyways, they were able to catch him clearly. They, they his DNA matched and his teeth marks match her body. So that is my that&apos;s your story. That&apos;s my<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            story. That&apos;s my story and I&apos;m sticking to it.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            But did she have a husband? Was she married? She was married because usually the husband&apos;s always the first person. She had an ex husband a reason. See, there you go. She also had a four year old son. Ah, she had another child, but I think that child because it says she&apos;s a mother of two, but I think that the oldest is probably old enough that they didn&apos;t identify her. You know, they just said she&apos;s a mother of two. And the ex husband did see her that morning. He was the last person to see her alive like physically cuz she dropped off her son with him.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Oh, well, I mean, I could. Yeah. But he does have an<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            alibi. She had his car. He claims he has an alibi. He didn&apos;t have his kids. He was out golfing. But she dropped the kids off. Apparently there&apos;s daycare or something like this.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            My golfing is more important. babysitting my kid. All right. Well, so he&apos;s up. He&apos;s obviously back in<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            jail. He is he&apos;s been in jail. He&apos;s been on death row for 14 years death row. He was supposed to be Yeah, he got sorry, I should probably maybe elaborate my story. He did get convicted for it. And sentenced to jail. He was supposed to be euthanized, I believe. Like a couple years ago, it got halted because they appealed the bite mark.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            I hear that bike marks are like, like junk science, that it&apos;s like really, people claim to be like professionals with it. But you don&apos;t even need to have like a degree or any sort of study. You could just be like, this cheat look like they match. I&apos;m an expert. Now. They did like<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            make a casing. But but by that point, you just have like a a drying or a scan or something. You&apos;re not really like digging up the body and trying to fit the the teeth into it. Right. Yeah. So I feel like I could understand why they want to throw that out. Because there&apos;s not but how can you throw out the DNA? Right?<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Well, and so he never admitted that he did it. There&apos;s<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            I don&apos;t know that story. Like, I don&apos;t know that information. I just know that he was convicted of it. Got it. Didn&apos;t say<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            I&apos;m assuming that they&apos;re going to try and throw out the teeth marks that he never write.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            I&apos;m assuming that he&apos;s saying he&apos;s,<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            he&apos;s innocent. But yeah, DNA does. I mean,<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            but they were able to identify that he was the caller. That called the first real estate agent that he was supposed to meet across the street, right?<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            And he was probably mad that she brought her husband and he was like, dammit,<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Ray ruin my plan. Exactly. But then, like, waited around to see if the husband left and saw Sarah Walker go in by yourself.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Well, rest in peace or walker. Your how many years ago? 20 2006 I can&apos;t do math right now.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            It&apos;s a long time ago that too much wine already? Oh,<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            well. My daughter was born in 2005. So 15 years ago. So God, that&apos;s very sad. I have a really hard time figuring out what the lives would be now and maybe the psychic. Yeah, the psychics fun. They actually did. I haven&apos;t. But I thought it was like, whatever it was. I would feel like they<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            did get in hypnotist. And he put them under hitmen. Like, like to like tie some get his mind to relax and go back to the That sounds more legit.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            I mean, I<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            don&apos;t think either way is legit. I&apos;m sorry. That&apos;s true. But you&apos;re right. I can get anybody to tell me anything. Doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s right or not. I can get them to tell it. Yes. By calming them down and feeling in the safe place.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Yes. You&apos;re gonna save space. You&apos;re all your feelings are valid here. Yes. The second one I I&apos;m having a hard time figuring out what the second one would be.<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            Do you want me to tell you should we wait till next week? We<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            can wait until next week. Okay. But I&apos;m I&apos;m very intrigued to figure out your story sounds vaguely familiar now that you&apos;ve told it? I think I did watch like some sort of crime show that did discuss that. But you were a lot more thorough and refreshing my memory. Yeah, the name The name didn&apos;t ring a bell. But the murder<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            actually changed like, at least the company that she worked with changed how their real estate agents were sent to these houses. So now it&apos;s like two real estate agents at the same time.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            You would think that that would be just standard<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            but my that&apos;s a shame although I mean when we look for houses<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            That&apos;s true. We only had one person, right? And that person could have killed us could have gone both ways. Or you<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            go into like an open door and then just wait. The Killers right there. You have no idea.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Oh my god. Yeah, that&apos;s like, I don&apos;t know if you know much about Israel keys. He&apos;s fresh on my mind right now because I&apos;ve been listening to lots of pipe podcasts about him. And he&apos;s like, I&apos;m obsessed with him. But he was like one of those people who like light and wait for like an opportunity. He didn&apos;t ever really have like a target. Yeah, he would just be like sometimes. And he they interviewed him and he was like, well, sometimes you get people you didn&apos;t really want but it was opportunity. So you just take it. I&apos;m just like, holy crap. Okay. Didn&apos;t really bad. pisses me off. Like, yeah,<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            what do you mean? I bet none of them wanted to be killed in the first place.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Exactly. Well, not and he he refused, like so many people don&apos;t know about him is because he made the police called, like, be quiet about his name, like not put any press out about him because he didn&apos;t want his daughter to be associated with him. I heard that and I&apos;m like, you killed people who were like kids of parents and you can&apos;t<br />
            <br />
            Raynee King  <br />
            do anything to your daughter.<br />
            <br />
            Gretta Jane  <br />
            Right? We&apos;re doing them. Yeah.<br />
